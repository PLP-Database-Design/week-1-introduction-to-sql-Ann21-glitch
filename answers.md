Question 1:

Components of a DBMS
Database Engine: Manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

Database Schema: Defines the structure of the database, including tables, fields, and relationships.

Query Processor: Interprets and executes SQL queries.

Transaction Management: Ensures data integrity by managing transactions.

Security Management: Controls access to data and ensures data security.


Question 2:

A relational database organizes data into tables (relations) that are linked by keys.

Examples:

MySQL

PostgreSQL

Oracle Database

Microsoft SQL Server


Question 3:

DDL (Data Definition Language): Commands for defining database structures. Example: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.

DML (Data Manipulation Language): Commands for manipulating data. Example: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

DCL (Data Control Language): Commands for controlling access to data. Example: GRANT, REVOKE.

Question 4:

Primary Key: A unique identifier for a record in a table. Example: id column in a user table.

Foreign Key: A field that links to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship. Example: user_id in an orders table linking to id in a user table.


Question 5:

An ERD is a visual representation of the entities in a database and their relationships. It helps in designing and understanding the database structure.


Question 6:

Advantages of Relational Databases
Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.

Flexibility: Easy to add and modify data.

Security: Robust security features to control access.

Scalability: Can handle large volumes of data and complex queries.


Question 7:

Types of Data Types
Integer: Stores whole numbers.

Varchar: Stores variable-length strings.

Date: Stores date values.

Boolean: Stores true/false values.


Question 8:

A DBMS allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management, ensuring data integrity, security, and accessibility.
