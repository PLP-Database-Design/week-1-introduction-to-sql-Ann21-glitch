# Question 1:Components of a DBMS

i) **Database Engine**: Manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

ii) **Database Schema**: Defines the structure of the database, including tables, fields, and relationships.

iii) **Query Processor**: Interprets and executes SQL queries.

iv) **Transaction Management**: Ensures data integrity by managing transactions.

v) **Security Management**: Controls access to data and ensures data security.


# Question 2:

A relational database organizes data into tables (relations) that are linked by keys.

Examples:

i) MySQL

ii) PostgreSQL

iii) Oracle Database

iv) Microsoft SQL Server


# Question 3:

i) DDL (Data Definition Language): Commands for defining database structures. Example: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.

ii) DML (Data Manipulation Language): Commands for manipulating data. Example: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

iii) DCL (Data Control Language): Commands for controlling access to data. Example: GRANT, REVOKE.

# Question 4:

Primary Key: A unique identifier for a record in a table. Example: id column in a user table.

Foreign Key: A field that links to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship. Example: user_id in an orders table linking to id in a user table.


# Question 5:

An ERD is a visual representation of the entities in a database and their relationships. It helps in designing and understanding the database structure.


# Question 6:Advantages of Relational Databases

i) **Data Integrity**: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.

ii) **Flexibility**: Easy to add and modify data.

iii) **Security**: Robust security features to control access.

iv) **Scalability**: Can handle large volumes of data and complex queries.


# Question 7:Types of Data Types

i) **Integer**: Stores whole numbers.

ii) **Varchar**: Stores variable-length strings.

iii) **Date**: Stores date values.

iv) **Boolean**: Stores true/false values.


# Question 8:

A DBMS allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management, ensuring data integrity, security, and accessibility.
